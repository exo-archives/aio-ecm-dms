/**
 * This interface specifies the contract of the Service which manages File
 * Definitions. A File Definition contains among other things Forms definitions.
 * It is required to persist File definitions somewhere as Forms need to be
 * retrieved if eXo is restarted. It was decided to define a Service to do that,
 * which makes it possible to allow various types of storage (eg: File System,
 * ECM).
 * 
 * <i>This interface is currently part of the Bonita 
 * package as jBPM has a 
 * built-in facility to manage File Definition. It may however be a good idea to
 * move it to the api 
 * package to make things common.</i>
