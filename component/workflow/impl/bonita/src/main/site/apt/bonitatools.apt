Bonita tools
  
  Bonita bundles a Swing console that enables to monitor and design Processes. Although it does not cover
  all functionalities, it is possible to reuse it for basic needs. eXo-Bonita provides a convenient
  script to launch it. Windows users should execute "%JONAS_ROOT%\bin\nt\manager.bat" and Unix users should
  execute "$JONAS_ROOT/bin/unix/manager". Appropriate settings have been brought so that you can connect
